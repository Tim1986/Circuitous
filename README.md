## Overview

Circuitous is a productivity app with a one of a kind way to visualize your day.

Input a series of activities, each with a name, date, start time, and end time. Those activities are then shown to you with a breakdown of your day in a pie chart that functions like a 24 hour clock face.

As an example, this screenshot has events from the following times:

12:00 am to 8:00 am (in pink), 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm (in purple), 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm (in yellow).

The app also tracks the activities in a fully functional calendar.

## Development

This app uses Bootstrap, Ajax, ChartsJS, MomentJS, and Calendar.

Timothy Brahm, Erin Ruth Maness, Craig McAlister, and Max Szczepaniak developed this app together as their first of three projects in their three month coding boot camp at UNC Charlotte.
